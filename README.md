If not, please refresh the page again and wait till the time the hand gesture detector is ready. 

After that. Press start.

Press keys 1,2,3 to add beats. You can enter beats in any order and in any quantity. 

Press key 0 to stop.

Raise right hand to increase tempo
Raise left hand to decrease tempo

## Troubleshooting
Sometimes the hand-gesture tempo control doesn't work, for that please reload the page for the Tensorflow API to load. 

## Thank you!
