# beatsbyishan

## Intro
This project is a web application that lets one play different drum beats and control the tempo using their hands.

## How to use
Go this link https://ishan710.github.io/beatsbyishan/ 

Press start.

Press keys 1,2,3 to add beats. You can enter beats in any order and in any quantity. 

Press key 0 to stop.

Raise right hand to increase tempo
Raise left hand to decrease tempo

## Troubleshooting
Sometimes the hand-gesture tempo control doesn't work, for that please reload the page for the Tensorflow API to load. 

## Thank you!
